# SMS Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project is a Machine Learning based application that detects whether an SMS message is *Fraud (Spam)* or *Genuine (Ham)*.  
It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze SMS text and an interactive GUI built using Streamlit for real-time prediction.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to automatically identify fraudulent SMS messages that may contain fake offers, phishing links, or misleading information.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NLTK (Text preprocessing)
- spaCy (Lemmatization)
- TF-IDF (Feature Extraction)
- Naive Bayes (Machine Learning Model)
- Scikit-learn
  Vscode notebook


  ## Project Workflow
1. Load SMS dataset
2. Clean and preprocess text data
3. Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF
4. Train Naive Bayes classification model
5. Evaluate model performance
6. Predict SMS fraud using GUI
